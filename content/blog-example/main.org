* I may have something to write about in the future...

** LaTeX math

\begin{equation}                        % arbitrary environments,
x=\sqrt{b}                              % even tables, figures, etc
\end{equation}

If $a^2=b$ and \( b=2 \), then the solution must be
either $$ a=+\sqrt{2} $$ or \[ a=-\sqrt{2}. \]

** Including code from a file

#+include: ./main.cpp src c++ :lines "3-6"
